#Midterm: Word Frequency in Speeches
Spring 2017

One of my main interests are analyzing text and producing the results with a visualization. The goal for this assignment was to visualize the results of a concordance using a chart to show the frequency of words in a speech.

#Inspiration:

Concordance: an alphabetical list of the words (especially the important ones) present in a text, usually with citations of the passages concerned.

#Process
I began my process by first creating a word count in javascript for an MLK speech.
