#Midterm: Word Frequency in Historical Speeches

The goal for this assignment was to visualize the frequency of words in speeches. I didn't want to get too political and have just Presidential speeches. I thought about focusing on speeches that were memorable to our society.

Speeches I focused on:
* Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech
* Barack Obama's first State of the Union speech
* Preseident Donald Trump's first State of the Union speech

#Process

I began my process by first cleaning the text files for all the speeches. I cleaned up extra spaces and took out the quotations for the javascript code.

I then created the word count in javascript testing with the MLK speech.
