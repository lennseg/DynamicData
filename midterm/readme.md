#Midterm: Word Frequency in Historical Speeches

##Spring 2017

The goal for this assignment was to visualize the frequency of words in speeches. I didn't want to get too political and have just Presidential speeches. I thought about focusing on speeches that were memorable to our society.

Speeches I focused on:
* Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech
* Barack Obama's first State of the Union speech
* Preseident Donald Trump's first State of the Union speech

#Process
I began my process by first cleaning the text files for all the speeches.

Creating a word count in javascript for the MLK speech.
